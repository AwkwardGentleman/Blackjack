## Blackjack
This is a simple game of blackjack that can be run directly from Blackjack.py. Feel free to use the deck generator for use in your own code.

### How it works
deckgenerator.py generates a dictionary for a deck of cards assigning name and value.
This is transferred to blackjack.py which runs it all in the terminal. Chips can be gambled
and dealer will keep playing  with normal casino rules until all chips are lost.
